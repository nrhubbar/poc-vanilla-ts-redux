Proof of Concept: Vanilla TS Redux
---

This is just a simple example of how to use Redux in TypeScript, without any other UI Libraries.

I am working on another project currently, that as statemanagement gets more complex I want to use the Redux library to help manage it.

I am not convinced, yet, that the main project warrants using a UI Library like (React, Angular, Vite, or whatever else the hip kids are using these days.)

## What does it do?

If you download the project, then run `npm install`, then `npm run build`, then you can launch [`dist/index.html`](./dist/index.html).

This will give you a lil counter that you can now increment and decrement.
